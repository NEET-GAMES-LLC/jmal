Java Minecraft Abstraction Library

# What is this?

In one of my other projects I needed to add abstraction, it seemed like a good idea to make the code reusable for my other projects

# Who is this for?

This is mostly for me, but if one day I have expanded this library to be useful to other people then I may focus more of my time on this project. I don't know if it will ever get to that point. I plan to write "quick and dirty" code for my own purposes and refine it later.
